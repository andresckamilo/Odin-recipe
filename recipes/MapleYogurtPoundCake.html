        <h2>Author notes</h2>

        <p>I made up this recipe to satisfy a serious maple craving I had a couple weeks back. The cake is extremely moist; unless eating it just out of the oven, toast your slice to get some contrast between the crust and innards. I've made this cake three weeks in a row, and used the office toaster to make my perfect 3 pm snack. One tip: really make sure to pull the cake out of the oven right when it's done. If it stays in longer, it'll dry out a bit. - Rivka —Rivka</p>

        <h2>Test kitchen Notes</h2>

        <p>This pound cake drops the pounds of butter and sugar in favor of oil and maple syrup, creating a springy texture and glistening, shellacked exterior. The oil folded into the batter at the end was a technique new to us, but we think we can hold it responsible for the cake's sweet, crackly crust. Rivka's choice of Grade B maple syrup means that the maple aroma and flavor is pervasive without being cloying. The end result is moist and flavorful enough on its own, but fresh whipped cream and strawberries never hurt. - A&M —The Editors</p>
